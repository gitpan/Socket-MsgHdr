Revision history for Perl extension Socket::MsgHdr.

0.01  Wed Mar 26 22:46:07 2003
	- original version; created by h2xs 1.22 with options
		-b 5.6.0 -An Socket::MsgHdr

0.00  Prehistory
    - Socket::SendRecvMsg is functionally complete, but pack()s cmsghdr
      and msghdr structures itself in Perl (and unportably).  Earlier
      versions still packed full iovec structs, for no good reason.
