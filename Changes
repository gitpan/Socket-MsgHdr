    - (MsgHdr.pm) Update copyright and contact email, POD fixes.

    - (MsgHdr.pm) Silence uninitialized value warnings.  Socket::MsgHdr
      member attributes now default to empty strings (for buffer-like
      attributes) or zero (for `flags').  Thx LY, TLB, PE.

    - (MsgHdr.xs) Rename utility function, comment for clarity.  Small
      cleanup.

    - (ppport.h, &c.) Contemporary perl modularization.  ppport.h v. 3.19
      (perl 5.10.1), "lib/" directory layout.

	- original version; created by h2xs 1.22 with options
		-b 5.6.0 -An Socket::MsgHdr

0.00  Prehistory
    - Socket::SendRecvMsg is functionally complete, but pack()s cmsghdr
      and msghdr structures itself in Perl (and unportably).  Earlier
      versions still packed full iovec structs, for no good reason.
